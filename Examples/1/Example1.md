# Example 1: Ten Hundred

In this example, we convert a fictional trivial contract from standard legalese to use only the "ten hundred" most used English words. This is the approach Randall Munroe takes in [*Thing Explainer*](http://blog.xkcd.com/2015/05/13/new-book-thing-explainer/).

## Standard Legalese

> Bob hereby agrees to purchase 1000 widgets from Alice for a price of $10.00 per widget.
>
> Alice promises to deliver 1000 widgets to Bob within 30 days of payment.

## Using the Ten Hundred Most Used Words

> Bob agrees to buy 1000 things from Alice for $10.00 for each thing.
>
> Alice promises to give 1000 things to Bob within 30 days of getting paid.
